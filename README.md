# Solver for stiff ordinary differential equations

There was no free solver for ordinary differential equations available written in C-sharp and thus compatible with Unity. This repository consists of a very specific implementation of Runge-Kutta resembling the predator-prey relationship described by Lotka and Volterra. This code can potentially be adapted to simulate population dynamics for any given setting.

When I find the time, I might extend this with:

1. a unity scene showing how to use this code
2. a more dynamic generator for the differential equations
